### Welcome to the Liao Research Lab! I am a systems biologist with a background in physics and computation. My lab focuses on microbial metabolism within the human gut microbiome. Our long-term goal is to uncover the mechanistic links between the intestinal microbiota and diseases and to develop a computational platform that will aid in the rational design of microbiome-based therapies.
